## Getting Started
In order to make use of the workout log, the user must first login. After that, the user is able to add workout sessions, execises, and one muscle group(s) per workout. The user is also able to update a few elements of the workout or delete the workout including the exercises embedded in it as well as the reference for the muscle group.

## Next Steps 
Future enhancements for this web application would be to give it a responsive design. This would make it convenient to use because users can then use the application on a mobile device with ease. Another enhancement would be to add update and delete functionality to the exercises.
